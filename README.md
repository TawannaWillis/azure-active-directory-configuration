<h1>Active Directory Configurations in Azure</h1>

<br /><h2>Objectives</h2>
This lab builds upon the previous one where I installed Active Directory and set up a domain controller. In this lab, I will configure Active Directory, join a client to the domain, and create user accounts.. <br />

<h2>Skills</h2>

- Azure Administration
- Active Directory Deployment
- Virtual Machine Configuration
- Group Policy Management

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 Pro (21H2)

<h2>Configuration Steps</h2>

- Open the **Active Directory Users and Computers** console.  
- Right-click on your domain (e.g., `tawannatest.com`) and create a new **Organizational Unit (OU)**.  
- Create two OUs: `_EMPLOYEES` and `_ADMINS` (used for later PowerShell scripts).  
- Within the `_ADMINS` OU, create a new user (e.g., **Jane Doe**).  
- To grant admin privileges:  
  - Right-click the user and select **Properties**.  
  - Go to the **Member Of** tab and click **Add**.  
  - Add the user to the **Domain Admins** security group.  
- Log off as `labuser` and log in as `jane_admin` for further changes.

Before the client can join the domain, it is important to configure the DNS settings first. The DNS server has to pointing to the domain controller's private IP address. On the Azure portal, open the Networking tab and click on Network Interface. In the DNS servers, enter the domain controller's private IP address and save the changes. Restart the client VM in order to ensure the DNS changes are saved.

<p>
It is now time to make the client VM join the domain. In the System menu of the client VM, click on Rename this PC (advanced) and Change. Enter the domain and necessary credentials in order to let the client join the domain. I am logging in as Jane Doe for the purposes of the lab. It is important to note that the login credentials have to be input within the context of the domain path. The client should now be part of the domain. On the domain controller, the client should now appear in Computers in the Active Directory Users and Computers panel.

<p>
Before users in the domain can use the client computer, Remote Desktop has to be enabled for non-administrative users. While logged in as the administrator (in my case, Jane), open System Properties. Click on Remote Desktop and Select users that can remotely access this PC. Allow Domain Users access to Remote Desktop. Non-administrative users can now log in to Client-1. Normally a Group Policy can do the same and allows changes to many systems at once. For the purposes of this lab, a Group Policy won't be used to make this change.

<p>
Creating users can be done manually or through the use of a script. For this lab, I will be using a PowerShell script. The PowerShell script can be found <a href="https://github.com/AsiaPonder001/BunchofUsers/blob/main/README.md?plain=1)"> here. </a> On the domain controller, open PowerShell ISE as an administrator (and make sure you are logged in with an admin account on the domain controller). Create a new file and paste the script into ISE console. Run the script and observe the accounts being created. 
</p>

</p>
<p>
After creating the users, Client-1 can now be signed in as one of the new users that were created from the PowerShell script. Pick a name and simply sign in to the client with the context of the domain. In my case, it is ernestotest.com\bon.rovej.

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

Doing this lab has made me learn how to set up Active Directory and join clients to the domain. I also created users and assigned the necessary permissions. Active Directory is not difficult to learn despite all the menu navigation that takes place. This lab is a segway for me to learn about DNS settings in-depth and file permissions in action. I will go into detail about these topics in other labs.
